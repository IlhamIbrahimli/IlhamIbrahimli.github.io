            <div id="AboutText"><p>
                In my spare time I partake in leadership activities such as CCF and enjoy playing the flute. I have recently passed my Grade 6 exam and also won 2nd place in the Berkshire Chess Championships in 2019.
                I usually have something extracurricular going on wether it be Music Lessons, Language Lessons or playing in the Reading School Orchestra. I can speak 3 languages: English, Russian, Azeri and I am currently studying German for GCSE.
                But out of all my hobbies Computer Science is my favourite by far and I am planning on taking the GCSE qualification for it in Year 9 instead of having to wait until Year 11!
